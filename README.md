Algo-Vis is a simple, React-based visualization tool for understanding CPU scheduling and sorting algorithms.  
It allows users to input processes, arrival times, burst times, priorities, and a time quantum (where applicable) to visually understand how different CPU scheduling algorithms behave.  
It also provides visualizations of multiple sorting algorithms in action to help learners grasp how they differ step by step.

> ‚ö° **Note:** This project is currently under development. CPU scheduling algorithms are completed, and the sorting visualizer is in **Phase 2** (multi-algorithm support). Future updates will expand visualization to Searching algorithms as well.
