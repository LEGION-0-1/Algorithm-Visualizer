Algo-Vis is a simple, React-based visualization tool for understanding CPU scheduling algorithms.  
It allows users to input processes, arrival times, burst times, priorities, and a time quantum (where applicable) to visually understand how different CPU scheduling algorithms behave.

> ‚ö° **Note:** This project is currently under development (about 1/3 completed). Future updates will expand visualization to Searching and Sorting algorithms as well.
